```bash
# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install Redis
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

**CentOS/RHEL users:**
```bash
# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install -y nodejs

sudo yum install redis
sudo systemctl start redis
```

### Step 2: Download and Configure

```bash
# Download project
git clone https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/claude-relay-service.git
cd claude-relay-service

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy configuration files (Important!)
cp config/config.example.js config/config.js
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 3: Configuration File Setup

**Edit `.env` file:**
```bash
# Generate these two keys randomly, but remember them
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-encryption-key-write-randomly

# Redis configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

**Edit `config/config.js` file:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  server: {
    port: 3000,          // Service port, can be changed
    host: '0.0.0.0'     // Don't change
  },
  redis: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',  // Redis address
    port: 6379          // Redis port
  },
  // Keep other configurations as default
}
```

### Step 4: Start Service

```bash
# Initialize
npm run setup # Will randomly generate admin account password info, stored in data/init.json

# Start service
npm run service:start:daemon   # Run in background (recommended)

# Check status
npm run service:status
```

---

## üéÆ Getting Started

### 1. Open Management Interface

Browser visit: `http://your-server-IP:3000/web`

Default admin account: Look in data/init.json

### 2. Add Claude Account

This step is quite important, requires OAuth authorization:

1. Click "Claude Accounts" tab
2. If you're worried about multiple accounts sharing 1 IP getting banned, you can optionally set a static proxy IP
3. Click "Add Account"
4. Click "Generate Authorization Link", will open a new page
5. Complete Claude login and authorization in the new page
6. Copy the returned Authorization Code
7. Paste to page to complete addition

**Note**: If you're in China, this step may require VPN.

### 3. Create API Key

Assign a key to each user:

1. Click "API Keys" tab
2. Click "Create New Key"
3. Give the key a name, like "Zhang San's Key"
4. Set usage limits (optional)
5. Save, note down the generated key

### 4. Start Using Claude Code

Now you can replace the official API with your own service:

**Set environment variables:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/" # Fill in your server's IP address or domain according to actual situation
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="API key created in the backend"
```

**Use claude:**
```bash
claude
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Production Deployment Recommendations (Important!)

**Strongly recommend using Caddy reverse proxy (Automatic HTTPS)**

Recommend using Caddy as reverse proxy, it will automatically apply and renew SSL certificates with simpler configuration:

**1. Install Caddy**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install yum-plugin-copr
sudo yum copr enable @caddy/caddy
sudo yum install caddy
```

**2. Caddy Configuration (Super Simple!)**

Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:
```
your-domain.com {
    # Reverse proxy to local service
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000 {
        # Support streaming responses (SSE)
        flush_interval -1
        
        # Pass real IP
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        
        # Timeout settings (suitable for long connections)
        transport http {
            read_timeout 300s
            write_timeout 300s
            dial_timeout 30s
        }
    }
    
    # Security headers
    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        -Server
    }
}
```

**3. Start Caddy**
```bash
# Test configuration
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

# Start service
sudo systemctl start caddy
sudo systemctl enable caddy

# Check status
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

**4. Update service configuration**

Modify your service configuration to listen only locally:
```javascript
// config/config.js
module.exports = {
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    host: '127.0.0.1'  // Listen only locally, proxy through nginx
  }
  // ... other configurations
}
```

**Caddy Advantages:**
- üîí **Automatic HTTPS**: Automatically apply and renew Let's Encrypt certificates, zero configuration
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure by Default**: Modern security protocols and cipher suites enabled by default
- üöÄ **Streaming Support**: Native support for SSE/WebSocket streaming
- üìä **Simple Configuration**: Extremely concise configuration files, easy to maintain
- ‚ö° **HTTP/2**: HTTP/2 enabled by default for improved performance
