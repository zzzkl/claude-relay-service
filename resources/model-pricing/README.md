# Model Pricing Data

This directory contains a local copy of the LiteLLM model pricing data as a fallback mechanism.

## Source
The original file is maintained by the LiteLLM project:
- Repository: https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm
- File: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json

## Purpose
This local copy serves as a fallback when the remote file cannot be downloaded due to:
- Network restrictions
- Firewall rules
- DNS resolution issues
- GitHub being blocked in certain regions
- Docker container network limitations

## Update Process
The pricingService will:
1. First attempt to download the latest version from GitHub
2. If download fails, use this local copy as fallback
3. Log a warning when using the fallback file

## Manual Update
To manually update this file with the latest pricing data:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json -o model_prices_and_context_window.json
```

## File Format
The file contains JSON data with model pricing information including:
- Model names and identifiers
- Input/output token costs
- Context window sizes
- Model capabilities
